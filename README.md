# appraisal
 platform in which members post "their point of view on a particular topic" one after the other after everyone has rated the previous post maybe on 5. 
 It will likely use stars as the case is for apps rating and at the end of a session (when ratings on a post are ended), we can display that oppinion in the 75%++ corner if more it gathered more than 75% positive ratings considering 3 stars and above as a positive rating.
